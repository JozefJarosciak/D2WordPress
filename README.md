Discord to WordPress image ingestion


A multithreaded Python script that uploads AI-generated images uploaded to Discord (e.g. Midjourney or any channel) and sends the full high-resolution version of the image automatically to Amazon S3 storage (creates thumbnails as well) and also auto-creates each image as a post (along with the details) in the WordPress website. This is where either you as an author or people (if you share it with the online community) can see the collection process in real-time (as the archiving process takes place).
